# Programming-Challanges
So yeah these are just me messing around and learning to program better. Mainly all are pygame simulations and stuff.

## Particles
A python port of The Coding Train's [particle system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdigVaIYAk)

This was very informative to do, and was my first time porting from js to python (the superior language).

## DotsAndSpots
A simulation of a "war" between two colors, blue and red. There are gray squares the will create a new starting point for the color that touches it first. Holding left-click will draw new circles, scroll-wheel withh change color to draw, and right-click creates a gray square.

## Sim#4
Messing around with lines and endpoints.

## Sim#5
Circles spawn with 2 different properties, color and dots. Clicking on two circles created a new one, the color being the average of the two colors and the dot color being the average of the two dot colors.

## Sim#6
"Estimating" where the mouse will click, really just is an average of all mouse clicks. Pretty buggy.

## Randomness
Just random rectangles and circles.

## drawingCircles
A very basic drawing program. Scrolling on the mouse wheel will change the hue of the color, right-clicking will change the value. Holding left-click will draw.

## circlesimulation
Randomly chooses pixel on screen. If the pixel is black, increases size and draws white circle. If the pixel is white, decreases size (more than black increases) and draws black circle. Also some stuff with blue circles.

This was fun to watch, as it eventually becomes a noise texture that isn't just a random value for each pixel.
